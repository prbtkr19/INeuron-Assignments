    "- A class which contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class.\n",
    "- An abstract class can be considered as a blueprint for other classes.\n",
    "- It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class\n",
    "- While we are designing large functional units we use an abstract class.\n",
    "- When we want to provide a common interface for different implementations of a component, we use an abstract class. \n",
    "- By default, Python does not provide abstract classes.\n",
    "- Python comes with a module that provides the base for defining Abstract Base classes(ABC) and that module name is ABC.\n",
    "- ABC works by decorating methods of the base class as abstract and then registering concrete classes as implementations of the abstract base.\n",
    "- A method becomes abstract when decorated with the keyword @abstractmethod. \n"
